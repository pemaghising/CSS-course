        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I’m a Motion and Graphic Designer with over 7 years of experience bringing stories to life through design and animation. My work spans across different media — from digital platforms and social campaigns to explainer videos and brand identities.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe good design goes beyond aesthetics — it’s about communicating ideas clearly, creating emotion, and solving problems. Over the years, I’ve worked with a wide range of brands, teams, and industries, helping them turn concepts into visuals that connect with their audience.

                <h3>My Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    Every project starts with understanding the goal. I combine creativity, technical skills, and design thinking to create visuals that are not only eye-catching but meaningful. I enjoy experimenting with styles — from minimal, clean layouts to bold, dynamic motion pieces — always tailoring the design to suit the story.
